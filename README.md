# data2060final
In this project, we examine and build a Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch, testing it on the Iris dataset. We found work from a machine learning textbook that uses a scikit-learn Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the iris dataset, and reproduced the textbook's classification report and confusion matrix outputs. In our GNB class, we included train and predict methods, as well as methods to create the classification report and the confusion matrix. We then implemented unit tests to ensure the accuracy of our model. Ultimately, our outputs matched the work produced in the dataset.
